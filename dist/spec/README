1. Look into the ./mk directory to see if your
   system is supported. Check for a filename of the form
   $(OS).mk, where OS is the output of the 'uname -s' command.

   If you don't find one, copy one of the existing files and
   make any necessary adjustments. For a system using the
   GNU compilers, start with 'OSF1.mk'.

2. Type 'gmake' in the top level directory.
   This will build 

   ./src/libspec.a 

   against which you have to link your own programs, and

   ./src/parser

   which is used by 'genspec' to generate the reading routines from a
   *.spec file.

3. The ./data directory contains an example 'data.spec' file.
   Always use the *.spec file which corresponds to your
   actual data files. You can always regenerate the 
   atrdmpgen.[ch] files from scratch by simply deleting them
   and typing 'gmake' again.
